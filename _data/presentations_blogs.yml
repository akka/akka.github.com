  content: In this series we are going to explore Akka Typed, the new Akka Actor API that brings significant advantage over the classic one. If you’re not familiar with the Akka Actor API, don’t worry — this series is intended to be understandable even if you do not. If you are familiar with the Actor API then this series will help you understand and learn how to work with Akka Typed.

  author: by Jacek Kunicki at GeeCON Kraków
  content: An alpaca is like a camel, but is Alpakka like Apache Camel? Can we use the reactive approach in the area of integration as well, instead of the blocking approach that Camel usually offers? In this live coding session we’re going to explore the possibilities that Alpakka - a set of connectors for Akka Streams - offers to fetch data from various data sources and send it to different destinations. Using those, you’re going to learn, on a working example, how to build a reactive integration layer with the help of Akka Streams - one of the most popular Reactive Streams implementations. And if you thought Akka and friends were only for the Scala people, come to learn the nice Java APIs and see how wrong you were.

  content: It is natural to adopt the Akka Streams API for inherently streaming workloads. However, the Akka Streams API is much more broadly applicable and it can be used to address many problems that you may not initially think of as streaming problems.

  content: Building distributed systems is hard. Pesky things like the laws of physics get in the way of maintaining state accross geographically (and chronologically) disparate systems, and, if that weren’t already outrageous enough in itself, those systems may be subject to network failures, forcing us to think about annoying tradeoffs regarding consistency, availability and the meaning of life.

  content: One of the most fundamental things when designing a stream is error handling and there are multiple ways to approach it in Akka Streams. Now, having all of this in mind, let’s see how to iteratively tackle this problem in a real-world example.

  content: After realizing the power of the Akka Streams API, people are often confused as to how it relates to Akka Actors. Some people question if actors are even necessary. Actors are definitely necessary. Actors solve complimentary problems.
