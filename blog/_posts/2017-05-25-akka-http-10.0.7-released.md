Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce Akka Http 10.0.7, which is the seventh release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. This is a regular 
maintenance release that contains several maintenance fixes, improvements and features that are a result of our ongoing 
collaboration with the Play team towards making Akka HTTP the default backend in Play’s upcoming major release.

## Notable changes

A total 29 issues were closed since 10.0.6. Out of those, the most notable ones are listed below.

You can view the complete list of closed issues can be found on the [10.0.7](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/25?closed=1) milestone on github.

### New documentation theme (aligned with new theme in Akka)

Today, as follow up to yesterday's [Akka 2.5.2 release](https://akka.io/blog/news/2017/05/24/akka-2.5.2-released), 
Akka HTTP also moves to using the new documentation theme. This is the first step towards even more simplification
and restructuring of the documentation such that everything is simple to find, and also being able to add more practical 
examples in the future.

We are aware that the search functionality is currently non-operational, and are working towards resolving it.
The indexing mechanism of the 3rd party search engine is not yet able to work with our new structure - please
be patient for a little while while we resolve this issue.

### New Seed Templates for Akka HTTP Apps

We prepared new seed templates for starting out with Akka HTTP using the [Java DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8)
as well as [Scala DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-scala-seed.g8). By using the sbt new command one can now easily get a
small sample project to easily get started with your first Akka HTTP app. More instructions on the seed template pages.

### New Path Directive `ignoreTrailingSlash`

Akka HTTP treats differently by default a route that ends with slash (/) than one that doesn't. From this version on, 
users who don't want to have this distinction, can use a new Path Directive called ignoreTrailingSlash. This route, will 
retry its inner route with and without a trailing slash. If you want to know more about this feature, please check the 
documentation pages for Scala and Java API.

## List of Changes

### Improvements

#### akka-http

* Added new Path Directive ignoreTrailingSlash ([#880](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/880))
* Prepared new seed templates for Akka HTTP apps (for both [Java DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8) and [Scala DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-scala-seed.g8))  ([#1137](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1137) & [#1055](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1055))
* Migrated to the new docs theme (same as Akka) ([#1129](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1129))
* (ApiMayChange) `HttpApp#route` method was renamed to `routes` to highlight it is "all the routes" ([#953](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/953))

#### akka-http2-support

* Synthetic Remote-Address header setting is now honored in HTTP2 server blueprint ([#1088](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1088))

### Bug Fixes

#### General

* OSGi Import-Package ranges have been fixed to allow Akka 2.5.x [#1097](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1097)

#### akka-http-core

* Dates in RFC1123 format with single-digit-day are now properly parsed [#1110](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1110) 
 
## Compatibility notes

This version is compatible with Akka 2.4.x as well as the current 2.5.1, so we encourage you to use Akka 2.5 with this version, as the new completely redesigned materializer in Akka Streams can result in various performance and memory usage improvements across the board.

If you want to use Akka HTTP together with Akka 2.5.1 make sure to include a dependency to akka-stream 2.5.1 and not only to akka-actor 2.5.1 (otherwise, your app may fail at runtime because of incompatibilities between a 2.4.x version of akka-stream and a 2.5.x version of akka-actor).

Akka 10.0.x is backwards binary compatible with previous 10.0.x releases and Akka 2.4.x. This means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). It should be noted that Scala 2.12.x is is not binary compatible with Scala 2.11.x.
