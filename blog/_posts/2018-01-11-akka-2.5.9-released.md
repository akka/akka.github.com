Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. This release mostly contains small fixes across the board
and our continued work on Akka Typed. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.8 are:

- Provide a fail-fast on version number too low for libraries [#24030](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24030)
- expectNoMessage should consume the message from the queue [#24270](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24270)
- DDataShardCoordinator: Provide read-only access when waitingForUpdate [#24064](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24064)
- Graceful handover when cluster client receptionist shuts down [#24179](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24179)
- Add overload with Function0 predicate to ReceiveBuilder [#15446](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15446)

A total of 40 issues were closed since 2.5.8.
The complete list can be found on the [2.5.9](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/125?closed=1) milestone on github.
