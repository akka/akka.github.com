Dear hakkers,

We have just published a new patch release of Akka 2.5. This version contains a fix for [a regression introduced in Akka 2.5.10](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24622) which made rolling upgrades of an Akka Cluster from version 2.5.9 to 2.5.10 impossible.

In total 2 issues were closed since 2.5.10. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.11 milestone on github](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/127?closed=1).
Credits
For this release we had the help of 4 committers – thank you all very much!
