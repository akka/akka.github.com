Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce Akka Http 10.0.12, which is the twelfth maintenance release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. 
It is also the first maintenance release of the 10.0 series since [10.1.0 has shipped earlier this month](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released). 

As such, this a release containing almost exclusively backports addressing small bugs and improvements, including ones 
specifically aimed towards improving Akka HTTP usage within Alpakka, Play and Lagom. For a full overview of these 
tickets, please refer to [https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/1824](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/1824), 
and the [10.0.12 github milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/33?closed=1).

This release remains binary backwards compatible with the 10.0.x series, as usual, and documented in our 
[binary compatibility guidelines](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/compatibility-guidelines.html). 

At the same time, we’d like to encourage upgrading to Akka 10.1.x, as the upgrade process is very smooth and a number 
of improvements did not make it back to 10.0. 
See the [10.1.0 release announcement](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released) for more details.
