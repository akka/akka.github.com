Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the release of Akka HTTP 10.1.2, which is the third release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

Notably, this release:

 * Introduces "Graceful" Server Termination ([#118](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/118)): calling the newly introduced `terminate` on the `ServerBinding` will cause the binding to start gracefully rejecting new requests, while giving existing requests a deadline to complete normally.
 * Discards Entities in Default RejectionHandler ([#38](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/38)). Previously, when rejecting a request, the default rejection handler would not consume the request entity. The default rejection handlers have been updated to consume the request in this case.
 * Appends a newline to every element when streaming CSV (and NDJSON, [#1931](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1931)): Previously, CSV lines would only be interspersed with newlines, but no final newline would be sent. While arguably this was a bug in itself, it also had the unfortunate effect that a newline would only be emitted when the next CSV line became available, which is especially surprising in situations where CSV data is produced relatively slowly.
