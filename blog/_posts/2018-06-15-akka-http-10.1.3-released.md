Dear hakkers,


10.1.3 is the fourth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

This release addresses a critical memory leak issue introduced by the graceful termination infrastructure added in 10.1.2.
No other risky changes are made in this release, in order to make it a trustworthy fix drop-in replacement of 10.1.2.
