Dear hakkers,


10.1.4 is the fifth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

Among many other things, this release includes a fix for handling early responses in the client, HTTP/2 improvements and many updates to the documentation.

If you are using [Lightbend Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/home.html) with Akka HTTP, remember to also update this to the latest version.
