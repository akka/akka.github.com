Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. It contains an important security fix for a vulnerability that affects Akka systems that use Akka Remoting/Cluster with TLS and have configured the TLS `random-number-generator` to `AES128CounterSecureRNG` or `AES256CounterSecureRNG`. An attacker would be able to compromise the communication if these random number generators are enabled. See the [security announcement](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/security/2018-08-29-aes-rng.html) for more details.

We would like to thank Rafał Sumisławski at NetworkedAssets for bringing this issue to our attention

Please subscribe to the [akka-security](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security) mailing list to be notified promptly about future security issues.

A total of 5 issues were closed since 2.5.15. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.16](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/132?closed=1) milestone on github.

## Credits

For this release we had the help of 4 committers – thank you all very much!
