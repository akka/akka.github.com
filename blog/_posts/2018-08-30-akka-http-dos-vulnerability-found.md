Dear hakkers,

we want to inform you that a bug in Akka HTTP has been found that can be used as a Denial-Of-Service against Akka HTTP servers
when using `decodeRequest` and `decodeRequestWith` directives on Akka HTTP servers.

As the problem was shared publicly with us we want to give advance notice about it and provide a workaround until the release
of fixed versions of Akka HTTP.

Please subscribe to the [akka-security](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security) mailing list to be
notified promptly about future security issues.

When reporting security relevant information, please [follow our guidelines](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/security.html#reporting-vulnerabilities)
for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Description

Directives `decodeRequest` and `decodeRequestWith` which handle compressed request data don’t limit the amount of uncompressed
data flowing out of it. In combination with common request directives like `entity(as)`, `toStrict`, or `formField`, this can lead
to excessive memory usage ultimately leading to an out of memory situation when highly compressed data is received
(so-called "Zip Bomb").

Any code that uses `decodeRequest` or `decodeRequestWith` is likely to be affected.

## Workaround

Until we publish a fix that will limit the amount of memory by default, you can use this custom directive instead of
`decodeRequest` to guard against excessive decompressed data:

Scala:

```scala
def safeDecodeRequest(maxBytes: Long): Directive0 =
 decodeRequest & mapRequest(_.mapEntity {
   case c: HttpEntity.Chunked ⇒ c.copy(chunks = HttpEntity.limitableChunkSource(c.chunks))
   case e                     ⇒ e
 }) & withSizeLimit(maxBytes)
```

And replace all `decodeRequest ` usages with

```
safeDecodeRequest(maxDecompressedBytesToSupport)
```

Java:

```java
  RequestEntity chunkedWithLimit(RequestEntity entity) {
    if (entity.isChunked())
      return
        HttpEntities.createChunked(
          entity.getContentType(),
          akka.http.scaladsl.model.HttpEntity.limitableByteSource(((HttpEntity.Chunked)entity).getDataBytes().asScala()).asJava()
        );
    else
      return entity;
  }
  Route safeDecodeRequest(long maxBytes, Supplier<Route> inner) {
    return
      decodeRequest(() ->
        mapRequest(req -> req.withEntity(chunkedWithLimit(req.entity())), () ->
          withSizeLimit(maxBytes, inner)
        )
      );
  }
```

And replace all `decodeRequest(innerRoute)` with

```
safeDecodeRequest(maxDecompressedBytesToSupport, innerRoute)
```

## Severity

The CVSS score of this vulnerability is 7.3 (High), based on vector
[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:H/RL:W/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:H/RL:W/RC:C).

Rationale for the score:

 * A:H: Server runs into OOM, so availability is highly affected.
 * E:H: It’s relatively simple to exploit.

## Affected Versions

All released Akka HTTP versions are affected:

 * 10.1.x <= 10.1.4
 * 10.0.x <= 10.0.13

## Fixed Versions

We will release fixed versions as soon as possible.

Happy and safe hakking!
