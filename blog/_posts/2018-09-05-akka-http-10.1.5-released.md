Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.1.5 release of Akka HTTP. 10.1.5 is the sixth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

It is mainly intended to fix the [DoS vulnerability when using `decodeRequest`](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/akka-http-dos-vulnerability-found).

### Migration Notes

To avoid excessive memory usage we introduced two new limits that apply per default:

 * `akka.http.routing.decode-max-size`: This limit applies when you use `decodeRequest` to limit the amount of decompressed data. The default limit is 8 megabytes.
 * `akka.http.parsing.max-to-strict-bytes`: This limit applies when you use `HttpEntity.toStrict` or the `toStrictEntity` directive (and related directives). It will only collect up to the given amount data and fail otherwise. The default limit is 8 megabytes.

Depending on your application requirements, you may want to change these settings.

### **Changes since 10.1.4**

For a full overview you can also see the [10.1.5 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/43?closed=1):

 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity after uncompressing it with `decodeRequest` [#2137](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2137)
 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity when reading it into memory with `toStrict` [#2186](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2186)
 * Correctly set a default `parallelism` value when none is specified for HTTP/2 [#2165](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2165)
 * Avoid matching an empty pattern when using `PathMatcher.repeat` [#2097](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2097)
 * Add `ServerSentEvent.heartbeat()` to the Java DSL [#2187](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2187)
