Dear hakkers,

we are happy to announce the 10.1.5 and 10.0.14 releases of Akka HTTP. Both releases fix the DoS vulnerability in the
`decodeRequest` directive that was announced [last week](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/akka-http-dos-vulnerability-found).
Thanks [@tewe](https://github.com/tewe) and [@TheEmacsShibe](https://github.com/TheEmacsShibe) who brought that issue to
our attention.

More information about the vulnerability can be found [here](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/security/2018-09-05-denial-of-service-via-decodeRequest.html).

Please update as soon as possible.

### Migration Notes

To avoid excessive memory usage we introduced two new limits that apply per default:

 * `akka.http.routing.decode-max-size`: This limit applies when you use `decodeRequest` to limit the amount of decompressed data. The default limit is 8 megabytes.
 * `akka.http.parsing.max-to-strict-bytes`: This limit applies when you use `HttpEntity.toStrict` or the `toStrictEntity` directive (and related directives). It will only collect up to the given amount data and fail otherwise. The default limit is 8 megabytes.

Depending on your application requirements, you may want to change these settings.

### Changes in 10.1.5 since 10.1.4

For a full overview you can also see the [10.1.5 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/43?closed=1):

 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity after uncompressing it with `decodeRequest` [#2137](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2137)
 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity when reading it into memory with `toStrict` [#2186](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2186)
 * Correctly set a default `parallelism` value when none is specified for HTTP/2 [#2165](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2165)
 * Avoid matching an empty pattern when using `PathMatcher.repeat` [#2097](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2097)
 * Add `ServerSentEvent.heartbeat()` to the Java DSL [#2187](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2187)
 
### Changes in 10.0.14 since 10.0.13

For a full overview you can also see the [10.0.14 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/38?closed=1):

 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity after uncompressing it with `decodeRequest` [#2137](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2137)
 * Restrict the maximum size of a request entity when reading it into memory with `toStrict` [#2186](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2186)
