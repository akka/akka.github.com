Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.17 are:

* Remove rolling upgrade serialization of ORSet\[ActorRef\] [#25336](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25336). This includes a new guide for [rolling updates](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/rolling-update.html) 
* Don't automatically down quarantined nodes [#25632](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25632))
* Fix signature of Flow.monitor (source incompatible!) [#24812](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24812)
* Improved efficiency of deleting snapshots in Cluster Sharding, use together with Cassandra plugin version 0.90 [#25590](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25590)
* Sink.foreachAsync replacing Sink.foreachParallel [#25622](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25622)

A total of 44 issues were closed since 2.5.16. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.17 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/133?closed=1) on github.

## API changes in Akka Typed

### Actor

* A new API added for wrapping behaviors [#24792](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24792)

### TestKit

* Composition has been preferred over inheritence for the TestKit with an optional ScalaTest trait for starting/stopping
  an ActorSystem [#24598](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24598). See the [Async testing docs](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/testing.html#asynchronous-testing) for how to change your test.

### Persistence

* ActorContext has been removed from command handlers, if needed wrap the `PersistentBahavior` in a  `Behaviors.setup` [#25620](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25620)
* ByState Command Handler has been removed [#25655](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25655)
