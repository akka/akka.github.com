Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.18 are:

* Async DNS over TCP in case of truncated UDP responses [#25460](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25460)
* Fix DNS SRV records with port numbers larger than 32767 [#25760](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25760)
* Fix DNS cache time unit [#25860](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25860)
* Support IPv6 in Async DNS [#25687](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25687)
* Fix Java APIs when running with JDK 11 [#25777](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25777)
* New `MemberDowned` cluster event [#25854](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25854)
* More examples of Streams operators, thanks to [@salehkhazaei](https://github.com/salehkhazaei) and [@mehdimousavi1995](https://github.com/mehdimousavi1995). More contributions are welcome, see [#25468](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25468)
* Update to Aeron 1.11 [#25743](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25743)

Unfortunately some Java code doesn't compile with Akka 2.5.18 in Eclipse. We will release 2.5.19 as soon as this regression has been resolved.
If you are using Eclipse we recommend that you stay on Akka version 2.5.17.

A total of 66 issues were closed since 2.5.17. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.18 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/134?closed=1) on github.
