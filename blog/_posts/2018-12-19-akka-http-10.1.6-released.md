Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.1.6 release of Akka HTTP. 10.1.6 is the seventh release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.
See the full list of changes below. A main improvement is that 10.1.6 was built using Scala 2.12.8 which allows to use
Akka HTTP from Java with JDK 11.
                                                          
## Migration Notes

 * akka-http now requires to be run with Akka 2.5.19+ to support JDK 11 from Java (we maintain binary compatibility during the
   Akka 2.5.x series so the update should be painless).
 * `RoutingSettings` were moved to `akka-http` from `akka-http-core` (where they logically belong). Make sure to depend
   on `akka-http` when referencing this class (which your code will very likely already do because `RoutingSettings` cannot be used without the `akka-http` module).
 * `akka-stream-testkit` is now a provided dependency for `akka-http-testkit`, if you use `akka-http-testkit` also
   add a dependency to `akka-stream-testkit` into the mix

## Changes since 10.1.5
