Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.20 are:

 * Discovery and DNS APIs are now stable 
 * New stream functionality: SourceWithContext and FlowWithContext allows for keeping a context object “on the side” while processing an element. [#25951](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25951) 
 * Improvements of default shard rebalancing algorithm, [#26012](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26012)
 * The serializer manifest is now logged when a serializer is missing to help figuring out such errors [#26217](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26217)
 * The cluster join compatibility check now supports rolling upgrades [#26194](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26194)
 * An optimization to AtLeastOnceDelivery - only tick when there are unconfirmed deliveries [#26216](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26216)
 * Terminate StreamRef on node failure [#25960](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25960)
 * SelfUniqueAddress instead of Cluster parameter in some Distributed Data types (old signatures have been deprecated) [#25746](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25746)

A total of 72 issues were closed since 2.5.19. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.20 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/136?closed=1) on github.
