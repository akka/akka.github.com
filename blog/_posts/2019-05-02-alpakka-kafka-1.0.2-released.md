Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the general availability of Alpakka Kafka 1.0.2.

Changes:

* Improvements for transactional support
* Do not fail commits during a rebalance (avoiding `CommitFailedException`)

Please see the [release notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka-kafka/current/release-notes/1.0.x.html#1-0-2) in the Alpakka Kafka documentation.

Happy hakking!

â€“ The Alpakka Team
