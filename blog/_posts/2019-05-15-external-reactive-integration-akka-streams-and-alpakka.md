> An alpaca is like a camel, but is Alpakka like Apache Camel? Can we use the reactive approach in the area of integration as well, instead of the blocking approach that Camel usually offers? In this live coding session we’re going to explore the possibilities that Alpakka - a set of connectors for Akka Streams - offers to fetch data from various data sources and send it to different destinations. Using those, you’re going to learn, on a working example, how to build a reactive integration layer with the help of Akka Streams - one of the most popular Reactive Streams implementations. And if you thought Akka and friends were only for the Scala people, come to learn the nice Java APIs and see how wrong you were.
