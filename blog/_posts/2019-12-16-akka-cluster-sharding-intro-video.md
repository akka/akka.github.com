A ten minute overview of Akka Cluster Sharding, how it can help, and a code walk through of basic usage of the Akka Cluster Sharding API.
We review the architecture and code in the [Akka Cluster Sharding sample Scala app](https://github.com/akka/akka-samples/tree/2.6/akka-sample-sharding-scala), including how to integrate [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html) with Cluster Sharding.
     
For more information see the [Akka Cluster Sharding documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html).
