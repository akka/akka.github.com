A four-minute video explaining why it is bad to block inside an actor, and how
you can use custom dispatchers to manage blocking when you cannot avoid it.

The slides and sample code are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/raboof/akka-blocking-dispatcher).

For more information see the [Akka documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/dispatchers.html#blocking-needs-careful-management)
