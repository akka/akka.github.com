In this six minute video we go through what testkits that Akka provides for automated testing of your actors. We walk you through a couple of JUnit test examples using the testkits from Java and cover some useful patterns to make your actors easier to test.

For more details and both Java and Scala examples of using the testkit see the [Akka documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/testing.html)
