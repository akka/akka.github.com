Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce version 0.8.0 of Akka gRPC! This release introduces a
number of exciting new features, as well as moving us closer towards 1.0.0
which we expect to release in a number of weeks.

Major improvements include:

* Basic support for [gRPC Server Reflection](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md) [#380](https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc/issues/380), which allows interactive/dynamic clients to discover services and methods, based on the implementation in [Cloudstate](https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate/blob/master/proxy/core/src/main/scala/io/cloudstate/proxy/Reflection.scala)
* Support for [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md) [#695](https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc/issues/695), making gRPC usable for JavaScript clients in the browser, contributed by [@timw](https://github.com/timw)
* Support for custom trailing response headers [#838](https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc/pull/838), which for example can be used to implement [rich error responses](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/error/#richer-error-model), contributed by [@drmontgomery](https://github.com/drmontgomery)
* Improved client-side load balancing over multiple backend instances discovered through [Akka Discovery](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/discovery/) [#811](https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc/pull/811)
