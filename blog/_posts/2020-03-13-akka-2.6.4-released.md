## Reliable delivery

Reliable delivery is useful for interactions between actors that require at-least or effectively once processing. Lost messages are detected, resent and deduplicated as needed. In addition, it also includes flow control for
the sending of messages to avoid that a fast producer overwhelms a slower consumer or sends messages at a higher rate than what can be transferred over the network.

There are 3 supported patterns for point-to-point, work pulling and Cluster Sharding.

Even the primary purpose is to use this in an Akka Cluster it works with exactly the same APIs for a local `ActorSystem`. The flow control and work pulling mechanism can be equally important for local communication between actors.

You find more information and code examples in the [documentation for reliable delivery](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/reliable-delivery.html).

Since this is a new feature it's marked as [“May Change”](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/may-change.html). It needs feedback from real usage before finalizing the API, and your help with trying it out is very welcome. It is also not recommended to use this module in production just yet.
