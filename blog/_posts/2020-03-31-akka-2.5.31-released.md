Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce the 2.5.31 patch release of Akka 2.5. The release backports some API's to make it easier to write libraries that work with 2.5, but also feel 'native' when used with 2.6, particularly with the new Typed API's.

Notable changes:

* Make `ClassicActorSystemProvider.classicSystem` public API [#28851](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28851)
* Make both `ActorSystem` implementations implement `ClassicActorSystemProvider` [#28765](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28765)


A total of 4 issues were closed since 2.5.30. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.31 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/163?closed=1) on github.

## Credits

For this release we had the help of 4 committers – thank you very much!
