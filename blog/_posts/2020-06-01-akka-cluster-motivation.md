This short video highlights the pros and cons of building stateful applications with Akka Cluster. Akka Cluster is a tool for building stateful applications that gives developers access to powerful features such as Cluster Sharding, Distributed Data, and Pubsub without the need to bring in external dependencies such as distributed caches.

To learn more about Akka Cluster see the [documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster.html).
