Since [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc) is built on [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http) it is easy to use them together.

This video is a follow-up on the 5-minute [Introduction to gRPC](2020-04-08-akka-grpc-intro-video.md)

You find the slides and code [on GitHub](https://github.com/raboof/akka-grpc-http-video).
