A total of 42 issues were closed since 2.6.6. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.7 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/167?closed=1) on github.

## Remember Entities improvements

The store used for the Remember Entities feature of Cluster Sharding - keeping track of what shards and entities was started and starting them immediately rather than triggered by messages to the entities - has been separated from the storage of the internal Cluster Sharding state.
This means that it is now possible to stop using the deprecated `persistence` state store mode and switch to the default `ddata` state store mode, but still use a persistent store for remember entities.

For more details about the improvements see: [FIXME link]

For migration from the deprecated `persistence` mode, see: [FIXME link]
