This video introduces [Akka Projections](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/), a new Akka module to process a stream of events or records from a source to a projected model or external system. For example, it can be used to generate the read-side models in CQRS applications, publish data to message brokers or to other systems.

This video continues the series on Event Sourcing and CQRS:

* [Event Sourcing with Akka 2.6](https://akka.io/blog/news/2020/01/07/akka-event-sourcing-video)
* [CQRS with Akka 2.6](https://akka.io/blog/news/2020/02/05/akka-cqrs-video)

The source code used in the video is based on our CQRS samples:

* [Akka CQRS Sample in Scala](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=akka-samples-cqrs-scala)
* [Akka CQRS Sample in Java](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=akka-samples-cqrs-java)
