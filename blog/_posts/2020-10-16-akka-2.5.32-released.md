Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce the 2.5.32 patch release of Akka 2.5. The release backports some fixes.

This is expected to be one of the last releases in the 2.5 series, and we
encourage any users to plan their upgrade to 2.6. Our
[migration guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/migration-guide-2.5.x-2.6.x.html)
should help here.

Notable changes:

* Fix TLS 1.3 issues on JDKs which support it [#29121](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/29148)
* Handling of onSpinWait and its absence in AffinityPool [#28945](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28945)
* Testkit: more resilient check for available loopback addresses in SocketUtil on MacOS [#29608](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/29608)

A total of 4 issues were closed since 2.5.31. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.32 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/165?closed=1) on github.
