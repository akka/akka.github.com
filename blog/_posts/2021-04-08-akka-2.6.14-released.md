Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. This release brings an updated version of Jackson for akka-serialization-jackson to fix a security issue [#30126](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30126).
It is possible that the upgraded Jackson version is not completely source and binary compatible, altough we do not know of any particular issues.

Other noteworthy improvements in this release:

 * Possibility to stop and drain a MergeHub [#30057](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30057), thanks [@nivox](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Anivox)
 * Initial delay for typed timers [#30065](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30065), thanks [@nvollmar](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Anvollmar)
 * Stream attributes propagation for `Restart` operators [#24810](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24810) and `fromMaterializer` [#30141](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30141)

2.6.14 includes 21 closed issues. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.14 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/175?closed=1) on github.

For this release we had the help of 20 committers – thank you all very much!
