title: Akka 2.2.2 Released!
author: Endre Sándor Varga
short: Akka 2.2.2 Released
---

*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of ***Akka 2.2.2***. This is the second maintenance release of the 2.2 branch, containing documentation improvements and fixing several issues including:

 * Optimized vector clock comparison
 * CompundWrite support for the TCP module that allows batched writes
 * More robust handling of remote system restarts

 ... and several smaller fixes
 
 *This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.2.0, which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies. Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.*
